Before to run, install required cblas library if you have not

   "sudo apt-get install libblas-dev lapack-dev"


Step to run 


1) make sure the size of line 33 in "generate_input.py" and line 51 in "testing_gemm.cpp" are the SAME. 
   e.g 192, since 192 is the case I care. But you can freely change it.  
   here, M=N=K, since square matrix is my concern.
   
   in my setting, I set "transA as notrans, transB as trans", as "GEMM NT" is my concern.
   you can freely change the matrix' transpose option in line 61 & 62 in "testing_gemm.cpp".   

2)
   "python generate_input.py"
   
   to get "A_col_major.txt" and  "B_col_major.txt" 
    
   Initially, I set A as random number between [0, 10], B as all "1".
 
   Read comment line 36-40 to see how to initilize matrix A, matrix B differently

3) "g++ testing_gemm.cpp -lblas"
    
4) ./a.out   

    this execuatable reads the above generated input txt files. 

    It dumps result matrix C in "result_C_col_major.txt"


Notice, in all *.txt files, the matrix is column major, as the whole column is consecutive in memory.

That is

    input format        1 2 3 
                        4 5 6

    in memory it is [1, 4, 2, 5, 3, 6]

If you need to read .txt file into your CPU array.
See the function "read_txt_file" in "testing_gemm.cpp" for how I read column major txt files into a vector<float>
